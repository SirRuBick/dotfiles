# Neovim config
This is my personal neovim config.<br>
I am still adding things in as I lean more about nvim.<br>

## Plugins
+ [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim): Plugin Manager

## dependencies
+ git
+ ripgrep

## Keymaps
Some of the shortcuts I use frequently are listed here. <br>
In the following shortcuts, `<leader>` represents `space`.<br>

| Shortcut          | Mode     | Description                                                              | plugin                      |
|-------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `CTRL`+`o`        | N        | Cursor moves back to previous position                                   | Vim                         |
| `CTRL`+`i`        | N        | Cursor moves back to next position                                       | Vim                         |
| `CTRL`+`6`        | N        | Toggle between previous file with                                        | Vim                         |


## TODO
- document useful shortcuts, including folding ones, Comment, etc.
- random color themes
- setup filetype plugins
- setup plugins for tags and marks
- dap and dap-ui
- lspsaga
- config "github/copilot.vim"
- "folke/zen-mode.nvim"
- "preservim/vim-markdown" and "iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim"
- "stevearc/aerial.nvim"
- "folke/persistence.nvim"
- smarter yank and clipboard

### possible improvements
- more telescope plugins? and pickers?
- "simrat39/symbols-outline.nvim" is quite useful but can lspsaga do the same or not?
- "joechrisellis/lsp-format-modifications.nvim" is useful but needs to be added to lsp keymap after it's cleaned

### Plugins to explore
- "jackMort/ChatGPT.nvim"
- "ThePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim"
